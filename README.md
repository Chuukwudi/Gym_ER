# Gym_ER

I recently started going to the gym. I had to rely on more experienced trainers to watch and learn how an equipment is used. I sometimes googled the name written on the body of the equipment to read more details about each equipment, what muscles they trained and videos on how to use them. A thought came to me. Why not build an image recognition app that recognises an equipment by its photo and outputs details about the equipment? My internship was around the corner so I wrote to a gym owner who let me do the required work such as data gathering, labelling, etc. More details are in [Chukwudi_Ajoku_A0151658_Internship_Report.pdf](https://github.com/Chuukwudi/Gym_ER/blob/main/Chukwudi_Ajoku_A0151658_Internship_Report.pdf)
