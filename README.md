# Motivation

I recently started going to the gym. I had to rely on more experienced trainers to watch and learn how an equipment is used. I sometimes googled the name written on the body of the equipment to read more details about each equipment, what muscles they trained and videos on how to use them. A thought came to me. Why not build an image recognition web app that recognises an equipment by its photo and outputs details about the equipment? I wrote to a gym owner who let me do the required work such as data gathering, labelling, etc. More details are in [Chukwudi_Ajoku_A0151658_Internship_Report.pdf](https://github.com/Chuukwudi/Gym_ER/blob/main/Chukwudi_Ajoku_A0151658_Internship_Report.pdf). The above resulted to this project.
